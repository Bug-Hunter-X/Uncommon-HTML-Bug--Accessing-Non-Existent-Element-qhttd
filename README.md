# Uncommon HTML Bug: Accessing Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML/JavaScript where an attempt is made to manipulate a DOM element that does not exist. This can lead to unexpected behavior and silent failures, making it hard to debug.

## Bug Description

The bug lies in the JavaScript code's attempt to access and modify an element with the ID "myDiv2".  However, the HTML only contains an element with the ID "myDiv".  This incorrect ID lookup results in the script failing silently without throwing an error or indicating the problem to the developer. 

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe that the text within the `div` with ID "myDiv" does not change, as expected, and no error is reported in the browser's console.

## Solution

The solution involves careful checking for the existence of the element before attempting to modify it.  The improved code includes a check (`if (myDiv)`) to ensure the element exists before proceeding with the innerHTML modification.  This prevents the silent failure and provides a more robust solution.
